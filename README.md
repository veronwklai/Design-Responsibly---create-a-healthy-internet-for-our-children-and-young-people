We are Design Responsibly, a project created by @veronwklai to raise the awareness of making safe online products and services inclusive for young people, in particular for LGBTQ community. 

We have noticed an increased demand by commissioners, policy makers, charities and internet users to provide safe online spaces to enable children and young people (CYP) to meet and talk with each other. 

We believe in the mission of offering guidelines and practical tools to deliver effective and engaging digital services for both vulnerable and less vulnerable young people in the future.

What our future vision for the safe spaces online project is:
- Understanding of CYPâ€™s digital behaviours is limited - especially for particularly vulnerable CYP.
- Share a policy design and operation roadmap needed to deliver an online safe space
- Turn the Design Responsibly into Digital format and make it accessible 
- Create a community engaging and contributing on a shared platform 
- Making these ideas practical so that people can apply them in their planning and design process

The project is targeted to benefit youth service providers, in particualr related to LGBTQ communities,and student who are looking for references on building open source design principles. Moreover, we want to build up guidelines and milestones for any organisation approaching digitalisation involving young people users.

We have structured our plan of action creating a website to share contents and make the project visible to external users. [Ask Veron for milestones]
